<h1>BOVSTT</h1>
<h2>Buffer Overflow Vulnerability Services Tester Tool</h2>
Program to detect the existence of remote / local stack-based buffer-overflow vulnerabilities using the 
standard communication protocol for each service.<br>
The application allows to customize the testing mechanism of each service through templates, these 
templates are simply plain text files, which accept some kind of special words (see STF section), these files 
are stored in the <services> folder with a direct association between the protocol and the template and with 
the extension STF (Service Tester File).<br>
Currently the application version 2.5 supports the FTP, IMAP, POP3 and SMTP protocol.<br>
To carry out this task the application allows to specify different types of parameters.
